    description: `The story of New York as a city begins with a tree. Beneath the boughs of a tulip tree in 1626, Dutch governor Peter Minuit is said to have made a trade with the Lenape that the colonists interpreted as the purchase of Manhattan. Even as this once forested island and the lands around it were built up, trees continued to be part of its lore as landmarks and witnesses. A monument in Prospect Park marks where a huge white oak was felled in 1776 to slow the advancing British troops; in 1792, an American sycamore shaded the founders of the New York Stock Exchange.
    <br><br>
    Some fragments of native forest survived the growth of Gotham, including the 350-year-old "Alley Pond Giant" in Queens, yet over the centuries the ecology of the city has been constantly reshaped. The international trade that made New York a metropolis brought exotics like the weeping beech from Europe and Asia's royal paulownia, whose seeds were used to pack porcelain. The city's trees are now as globally diverse as its population, from Japanese cherries that arrived by ship to towering dawn redwoods thought extinct until they were rediscovered in China in the 1940s
    <br><br>
    The city's development further changed its nature, such as the tree-moving machines of Central Park in the 19th century meticulously placing the American elms favored by Frederick Law Olmsted. In the mid 20th century, Parks Commissioner Robert Moses prolifically planted hardy London plane trees, making their distinctive peeling bark ubiquitous.
    <br><br>
    As the city expanded, greenspace was increasingly fractured, and many arboreal elders were cut down, although a few had their saviors.
    In 1969, activist Hattie Carthan, who led efforts to plant hundreds of trees in Bedford-Stuyvesant, rallied to protect a southern magnolia in danger of being bulldozed. The wizened Camperdown elm in Prospect Park was in precarious health when in 1967, Marianne Moore wrote a poem that encouraged action not just to save the tree but also to revitalize the park.
    <br><br>
    Now with extreme weather and climate change, New York's environment will again be transformed, with trees being needed more than ever for the health of the city.
    <br><br>
    The 50 trees on this map are a snapshot of the oldest, rarest, strangest, and most historic of the around 5.2 million trees in the five boroughs, where despite the dominance of concrete, an urban canopy thrives through parks, botanic gardens, cemeteries, community gardens, yards, and sidewalk tree beds.
